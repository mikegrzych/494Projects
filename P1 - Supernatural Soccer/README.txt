Game Title: Supernatural Soccer

Medium:	Board Game

Team Members:
	Micah Bennett

	Tarrence Van As

Info:
	Supernatural Soccer is the result of our first assignment for EECS 494.
	The goal of the assignment was to iteratively develop a board game in
	approximately 2 weeks using feedback and notes gathered from internal
	playtesting and from class-wide playtests. The project grade was not
	solely based on the game itself, but a combination of the game's
      	mechanics, qualities, and how well our team tracked and responded to
	each playtest.
