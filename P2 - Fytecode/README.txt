Game Title: Fytecode

Medium:	Computer Game (2D)

Team Members:
	Michael Grzych

Info:
	Fytecode is my first real attempt at game design and coding. The game
	was built upon Mitchell Bloch's Zenipex Library (http://zenilib.com),
	a simple framework for creating computer games. The game's main code
	is written in C++, and took about 2 days to write and test.

	This repository includes a compiled Win32 executable version of the
	game, and can be played by using the "Play Fytecode.exe" executable.
	The source code from the game itself is located under /jni/application/.
