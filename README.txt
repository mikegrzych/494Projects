Info:
	This repository contains the 4 different projects I completed as part
	of the course EECS 494 - Computer Game Design. These games were made
	in multiple formats or with different frameworks and engines, and
	were designed using an agile and iterative design methodology.

Repository Outline:
	/P1 - Supernatural Soccer
		First project for the course; a physical board game designed
		to be played by 4 players divided into teams of 2. Features
		fast and strategic goal-oriented gameplay.

	/P2 - Fytecode
		Second project for the course; a 2D computer game for a 
		single player to be played with a mouse and keyboard. A short
		concept demo that features increasingly difficult gameplay
		reminiscent of older arcade titles.

	/P3 - Leave No Trace
		Third project for the course; a 3D computer game for a
		single player to be played with a mouse and keyboard. A
		minimal concept demo that mixes 3D platforming with
		time-limited elements of "endless runners" like Canabalt
		or Temple Run.

	/P4 - Collapse
		Fourth and final project for the course; a 3D computer game
		to be played over networks with 2 teams of 2-4 players each
		using game controllers such as the XBox360 controller. A
		prototype game that mixes 2D brawler elements from games like
		Super Smash Brothers with objective-oriented gameplay from
		popular multiplayer games like League of Legends or Team
		Fortress 2.
