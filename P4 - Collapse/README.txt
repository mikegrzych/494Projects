Info:
	Collapse was our final project for EECS 494, and for most of us was
	only our third or fourth game projects to ever see completion. The
	game was created using the Unity3D Engine (http://unity3d.com), and
	used code and scripts written in C# in order to define most of the
	game's functionality. This game took us approximately 5 weeks to
	complete from start to finish.

	This repository includes complied Win32 and Mac OSX Universal
	executable versions of the game, and can be played by running
	"Collapse.exe" and "Collapse.app" respectively. A portion of the
	source files used in the Unity3D project can be found inside the
	archive "SourceFiles.zip," and includes C# source used in the game.
