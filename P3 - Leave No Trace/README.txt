Info:
	Leave No Trace is my second attempt at game design and coding, and
	my first attempt at creating a game which utilized 3D game space.
	The game was built upon Mitchell Bloch's Zenipex Library 
	(http://zenilib.com), a simple framework for creating computer games. 
	The game's main code is written in C++, and took about 4 days to 	write and test.

	This repository includes a compiled Win32 executable version of the
	game, and can be played by using the "Play Leave No Trace.exe" 
	executable. The source code from the game itself is located under 
	/jni/application/.
